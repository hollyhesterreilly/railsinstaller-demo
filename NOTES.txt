Triage challenge app - Holly and Rick's notes

1. Data model

Participant
	name:string
	position:integer
	triages:integer
	
	rails generate scaffold Participant name:string position:integer

to add triages attribute, we need to generate a migration.
	rails generate migration add_triages_to_participants triages:integer
because we added this after, we have to change the view file
	add table header (<th>) and <td> to index.html

2. Weekly, run a task that sends an email
Trying this in EngineYard with cron job - 

	cd /data/triage_email_app/current && bundle exec rails runner -e production 'TriageTask.run'

Task performs logic to figure what email to send
- Which participant is on assignment
	sort by triages asc, position asc, limit:1
	increment that participant's triages value by 1
- Build email contents
- Send email to product_team@mediamath.com and ppo@mediamath.com

Feature/pictures
- we want to add the ability to insert a picture into the email
- the user can enter a url where a picture is
- the user can associate 0 or many names with that picture

Data model for this:
- url where pictures are
- participants may be associated with pictures
- whether picture has been used

Picture
	url:string
	uses:integer
	
	rails generate scaffold Picture url:string uses:integer
	
-we'll also need to associate them. we can use rails habtm associations:
	class Participant < ActiveRecord::Base
	  has_and_belongs_to_many :pictures
	end
	 
	class Picture < ActiveRecord::Base
	  has_and_belongs_to_many :participants
	end
this creates models, but we need those to be connected to tables, so we have to create a migration. we use the command line to do this, and it creates the participants_pictures migration file in the db folder.

	#mail :to => "product_team@mediamath.com", :cc => "ppo@mediamath.com, hollyhesterreilly@gmail.com", :subject => "Product Request Triage goes to..."
	
NOTE: To make email work, rick had to update the conf file on the server in etc for ssmtp.
