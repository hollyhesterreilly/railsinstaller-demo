Triage challenge app - Holly and Rick's notes

1. Data model

Participant
	name:string
	position:integer
	triages:integer
	
	rails generate scaffold Participant name:string position:integer

to add triages attribute, we need to generate a migration.
	rails generate migration add_triages_to_participants triages:integer
because we added this after, we have to change the view file
	add table header (<th>) and <td> to index.html

2. Weekly, run a task that sends an email
Trying this in EngineYard with cron job - 

	cd /data/triage_email_app/current && bundle exec rails runner -e production 'TriageTask.run'

Task performs logic to figure what email to send
- Which participant is on assignment
	sort by triages asc, position asc, limit:1
	increment that participant's triages value by 1
- Build email contents
